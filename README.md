# 🌾 Kisan Saathi — Farmer Crop Intelligence & Community Platform

A production-minded, rural-first agricultural platform for Indian farmers.
Built for low-bandwidth, multilingual, mobile use with practical AI integration.

> **🌟 Core Highlight**: As part of this comprehensive platform, **we have created our own custom AI models** specifically for localized agricultural needs. Our custom machine learning pipeline powers the **Plant Disease Detection** (analyzing crop photos) and **Market Price Prediction** algorithms to give farmers highly accurate, actionable insights.

## 🚀 Key Features & Modules

### 1. Custom AI Models (Our Innovation)
- **Disease Diagnosis**: We built our own custom vision model pipeline (integrated with multimodal AI layers) to instantly analyze plant and leaf photos. It detects diseases, provides a confidence score, and gives actionable remedies.
- **Price Prediction & Mandi Rates**: We developed a custom predictive model that analyzes historical market data (Agmarknet) to forecast crop price trends, helping farmers decide when and where to sell for maximum profit.

### 2. Kisan Mitra AI (Chatbot)
- Deeply personalized contextual chatbot for farmers.
- Supports regional languages (Hindi, Marathi, English) allowing farmers to speak in their native tongue.
- Provides advice on farming practices, weather impacts, and government schemes.

### 3. Community Feed
- A platform for farmers to share knowledge, ask questions, and post updates.
- Supports text posts and optional photo uploads via Cloudinary.
- Like and interact with posts from nearby farmers.

### 4. Transport & Logistics
- A dedicated shoutbox for booking transport vehicles (trucks, tempos) for carrying crops to the mandi.
- Match farmers with local transporters.

### 5. Multilingual & Earthy UI
- Designed with high-contrast, earthy tones suitable for outdoor visibility under the sun.
- Seamless toggling between English (EN), Hindi (HI), and Marathi (MR) to ensure extreme accessibility.
